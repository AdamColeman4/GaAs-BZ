# GaAs first BZ Model

# We know GaAs is FCC and we know the basis, first create the real space lattice, then transform into recpirocal space
# To plot Wigner-Seitz cell only plot space closest to a lattice point in reciprocal space
# Gives truncated octrahedron shape for the FCC lattice (BCC in reciprocal space), the opposite is the case for BCC direct lattice
